Agent-based models provide a method of simulating investor behaviour in an electricity market. Using this technique, we were able to observe the emergent investor behaviour. 

We observed that an increase in carbon tax had a significant impact on investment. These findings enable policy makers to better understand the impact that their decisions may have. For a high uptake of renewable energy technology, rapid results can be seen after 10 years with a carbon tax of \textsterling70.

Agent-based models open up the possibility of testing differing investor behaviours through techniques such as reinforcement learning. The effect of collusion can be modelled

Agent-based models are able to model imperfect information as well as heterogeneous actors. ElecSIM models imperfect information through forecasting of electricity demand and future fuel and electricity prices. This leads to agents taking risk on their investments, and more realistically model market conditions.

We demonstrated that increasing carbon tax can lead to a significant increase in investment of low-carbon technologies such as onshore wind. However, an interesting result was that early decisions have a long impact on the future energy mix. The market can be significantly changed through investment decisions made many years previously. 

Our future work includes comparing agent-learning techniques, using multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to allow agents to learn in a non-static environment. We propose the integration of a higher temporal and spatial resolution to model changes in daily demand, as well as capacity factors by region, and transmission effects.

@article{Curry2017,
abstract = {Executive Summary 1) Oversupply is depressing battery prices. Passenger EV sales were lower than expected in 2011-H1 2015, meaning demand for lithium-ion batteries was low. The manufacturing industry suffered – and is still suffering --from oversupply. To increase utilization, manufacturers have been lowering prices and competing fiercely with one another. 2) Tightening of the battery market. However, BNEF forecasts large demand growth for lithium-ion batteries, and battery manufacturers have announced further capacity build despite oversupply. They need to attract investment for this, although revenue from sales is still quite low, and say how they plan to make a profit from the new investment. 3) Supply chain economics will make it tougher to meet demand. Without the supply chain in place, the battery market will not be able to meet future demand. The supply chain for battery components (cathodes, anodes, electrolyte and separators) is a complex business. There's a looming shortage in production capacity for components, particularly the separator. EV sales growth in China, in particular, is creating separator supply bottlenecks.},

abstract = {This paper explores kernel spectral clustering methods to improve forecasts of aggregated electricity smart meter data. The objective is to cluster the data in such a way that building a forecasting models separately for each cluster and taking the sum of forecasts leads to a better accuracy than building one forecasting model for the total aggregate of all meters. To measure the similarity between time series, we consider wavelet feature extraction and several positive-definite kernels. To forecast the aggregated meter data, we use a periodic autoregressive model with calendar and temperature information as exogenous variable. The data used in the experiments are smart meter recordings from 6,000 residential customers and small-to-medium enterprises collected by the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The results show a 20{\%} improvement in forecasting accuracy, where the highest gain is obtained using a kernel with the Spearman's distance. The resulting clusters show distinctive patterns particularly during hours of peak demand.},

abstract = {This paper aims to develop a load forecasting method for short-term load forecasting, based on an adaptive two-stage hy- brid network with self-organized map (SOM) and support vector machine (SVM). In the first stage, a SOM network is applied to cluster the input data set into several subsets in an unsupervised manner. Then, groups of 24 SVMs for the next day's load pro- file are used to fit the training data of each subset in the second stage in a supervised way. The proposed structure is robust with different data types and can deal well with the nonstationarity of load series. In particular, our method has the ability to adapt to different models automatically for the regular days and anomalous days at the same time.With the trained network, we can straight- forwardly predict the next-day hourly electricity load. To confirm the effectiveness, the proposed model has been trained and tested on the data of the historical energy load from New York Indepen- dent System Operator.},

abstract = {Electricity price forecasting is extremely important for all market players, in particular for generating companies: in the short term, they must set up bids for the spot market; in the medium term, they have to define contract policies; and in the long term, they must define their expansion plans. For forecasting long-term electricity market pricing, in order to avoid excessive round-off and prediction errors, this paper proposes a new artificial neural network (ANN) with single output node structure by using direct forecasting approach. The potentials of ANNs are investigated by employing a rolling cross validation scheme. Out of sample performance evaluated with three criteria across five forecasting horizons shows that the proposedANNsare a more robust multi-step ahead forecasting method than autoregressive error mod- els. Moreover, ANN predictions are quite accurate even when the length of the forecast horizon is relatively short or long.},

abstract = {We propose a method to examine structural and behavioral determinants of residential electricity consumption, by developing separate models for daily maximum (peak) and minimum (idle) consumption. We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.},

Then, the distance measures are normalized and ordered, yielding a unitary index score, where the potential fraudsters or users with irregular patterns of consumption have the highest scores. The approach was tested and validated on a real database, showing good performance in tasks of fraud and measurement defect detection.},

abstract = {Data for aggregated hourly electricity demand shows systematic variations over the day, week, and seasons, and forecasting of aggregated hourly electricity load has been the subject of many studies. With hourly metering of individual customers, data for individual consumption profiles is available. Using this data and analysing the case of Denmark, we show that consumption profiles for categories of customers are equally systematic but very different for distinct categories, that is, distinct categories of customers contribute differently to the aggregated electricity load profile. Therefore, to model and forecast long-term changes in the aggregated electricity load profile, we identify profiles for different categories of customers and link these to projections of the aggregated annual consumption by categories of customers. Long-term projection of the aggregated load is important for future energy system planning, and the hourly load profile is an important input to energy system models that serves this purpose. In particular, these models often assume an unchanged hourly load profile (although the level may change). In contrast, our model suggests that the hourly load profile also changes as the shares of consumption by categories of customers change and new consumption technologies such as electrical vehicles and (for Denmark in particular) individual heat pumps are introduced. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Then SVR is used to model each disjointed regions to identify the characteristic correlation. In order to reduce the performance volatility of SVM (support vector machine) with different parameters, PSO is implemented to automatically perform the parameter selection in SVR modelling.

The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100{\%} renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {International climate change agreements typically specify global warming thresholds as policy targets 1 , but the relative economic benefits of achieving these temperature targets remain poorly understood2,3. Uncertainties include the spatial pattern of temperature change, how global and regional economic output will respond to these changes in temperature, and the willingness of societies to trade present for future consumption. Here we combine historical evidence 4 with national-level climate 5 and socioeconomic 6 projections to quantify the economic damages associated with the United Nations (UN) targets of 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming, and those associated with current UN national-level mitigation commitments (which together approach 3 °C warming 7 ). We find that by the end of this century, there is a more than 75{\%} chance that limiting warming to 1.5 °C would reduce economic damages relative to 2 °C, and a more than 60{\%} chance that the accumulated global benefits will exceed US{\$}20 trillion under a 3{\%} discount rate (2010 US dollars). We also estimate that 71{\%} of countries—representing 90{\%} of the global population—have a more than 75{\%} chance of experiencing reduced economic damages at 1.5 °C, with poorer countries benefiting most. Our results could understate the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 °C if unprecedented extreme outcomes, such as large-scale sea level rise 8 , occur for warming of 2 °C but not for warming of 1.5 °C. Inclusion of other unquantified sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in secular growth rates beyond that contained in existing socioeconomic scenarios, could also result in less precise impact estimates. We find considerably greater reductions in global economic output beyond 2 °C. Relative to a world that did not warm beyond 2000–2010 levels, we project 15{\%}–25{\%} reductions in per capita output by 2100 for the 2.5–3 °C of global warming implied by current national commitments 7 , and reductions of more than 30{\%} for 4 °C warming. Our results therefore suggest that achieving the 1.5 °C target is likely to reduce aggregate damages and lessen global inequality, and that failing to meet the 2 °C target is likely to increase economic damages substantially.},

abstract = {Analysis of the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is usually based on aggregate results on a population of cases. In this paper, we analyze ANN output corresponding to the individual case. We show variability in the outputs of multiple ANNs that are trained and "optimized" from a common set of training cases. We predict this variability from a theoretical standpoint on the basis that multiple ANNs can be optimized to achieve similar overall performance on a population of cases, but produce different outputs for the same individual case because the ANNs use different weights. We use simulations to show that the average standard deviation in the ANN output can be two orders of magnitude higher than the standard deviation in the ANN overall performance measured by the Az value. We further show this variability using an example in mammography where the ANNs are used to classify clustered microcalcifications as malignant or benign based on image features extracted from mammograms. This variability in the ANN output is generally not recognized because a trained individual ANN becomes a deterministic model. Recognition of this variability and the deterministic view of the ANN present a fundamental contradiction. The implication of this variability to the classification task warrants additional study.},

This paper proposes an agent-based model to simulate the efficacy of different promotional strategies that support the launch of a product. The article in particular concentrates on the targeting and the timing of the promotions. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that promotional activities highly affect diffusion dynamics. The findings indicate that: (1) the absence of promotional support and/or a wrong timing of the promotions may lead to a failure of product diffusion; (2) the optimal targeting strategy is to address distant, small and cohesive groups of consumers; and (3) the optimal timing of a promotion differs between durable categories (white goods, such as kitchens and laundry machines, versus brown goods, such as TVs and CDs players).

@article{Sapankevych2009,
abstract = {Time series prediction techniques have been used in many real-world applications such as financial market prediction, electric utility load forecasting , weather and environmental state prediction, and reliability forecasting. The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.},

abstract = {Reanalysis models are rapidly gaining popularity for simulating wind power output due to their convenience and global coverage. However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50{\%} in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30{\%} in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2{\%}, with countries ranging from 19.5{\%} (Germany) to 32.4{\%} (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23{\%} more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3{\%}. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4{\%} and Germany's to 29.1{\%}.},

abstract = {The increased penetration of smart meters generates huge amounts of fine-grained data, which may empower a new generation of energy related applications and services. Sig- nificant research efforts focus on the usage of such data to mainly improve the business processes of the electrical grid operators and provide some value added services to the end- users. Forecasting has a prominent position as it is a crucial planning step, and is mostly used to predict the grid load through highly-aggregated data. However, with the dra- matic increase on fine-grained data, new challenges arise as forecasting can now also be done on much shorter and de- tailed time-series data, which might provide new insights for future applications and services. For the smart grid era, be- ing able to segment customers on highly predictable groups or identify highly volatile ones, is a key business advantage as more targeted offers can be made. This work focuses on the analysis and impact assessment of in the context of smart metering data aggregation. A system to measure the impact of aggregation is designed and its performance is assessed. We experiment with measuring of the forecast accuracy on various levels of individual load aggregation, and investigate the identification of highly predictable groups.},

abstract = {This paper examines the influence of dwelling and occupant characteristics on domestic electricity consumption patterns by analysing data obtained from a smart metering survey of a representative cross section of approximately 4200 domestic Irish dwellings. A multiple linear regression model was applied to four parameters: total electricity consumption, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of maximum electricity demand for a number of different dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables. In particular, dwelling type, number of bedrooms, head of household (HoH) age, household composition, social class, water heating and cooking type all had a significant influence over total domestic electricity consumption. Maximum electricity demand was significantly influenced by household composition as well as water heating and cooking type. A strong relationship also existed between maximum demand and most household appliances but, in particular, tumble dryers, dishwashers and electric cookers had the greatest influence over this parameter. Time of use (ToU) for maximum electricity demand was found to be strongly influenced by occupant characteristics, HoH age and household composition. Younger head of households were more inclined to use electricity later in the evening than older occupants. The appliance that showed the greatest potential for shifting demand away from peak time use was the dishwasher. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

InnoMind is based on theories of emotional cognition from cognitive science, theories of attitudes and persuasion from social psychology, and theories of social networks from sociology. In a case study, we show how the model can be used to address practical research questions in environmental psychology: We describe computer simulations with InnoMind that can serve as ex-ante evaluations of suitable campaign strategies for the promotion of carsharing as an innovative means of sustainable urban transportation.

abstract = {Solar PV is rapidly growing globally, creating difficult questions around how to efficiently integrate it into national electricity grids. Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

One of the objectives in the development of the project is the classification of users according to their patterns of daily energy load profiles. Based on daily hour measures from a sample of residential users, a self-organizing map (SOM) has been trained to classify users according to a specific number of resulting patterns of daily load profiles, attached to a number of indices that define the users' energy consumption. The so-trained SOM classifier allows the characterization of future users based on their load profiles, thus estimating their energy consumption habits and potentially manageable energy.},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development of any nation. With increasing agricultural and industrial activities in the country, the demand for energy is also increasing. Formulation of an energy model will help in the proper allocation of widely available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydropower in meeting the future energy demand in India. During the last decade several new concepts of energy planning and management such as decentralized planning, energy conservation through improved technologies, waste recycling, integrated energy planning, introduction of renewable energy sources and energy forecasting have emerged. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand and review the various emerging issues related to the energy modeling. The different types of models such as energy planning models, energy supply-demand models, forecasting models, renewable energy models, emission reduction models, optimization models have been reviewed and presented. Also, models based on neural network and fuzzy theory have been reviewed and discussed. The review paper on energy modeling will help the energy planners, researchers and policy makers widely. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of smart grid research, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has become the first ubiquitous and fixed computing platform. However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than {\$}25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.},

The cost-saving potential of smart homes is an excellent motivating factor to involve users in smart grid operations. To that end, this survey explores the contemporary cost-saving strategies for smart grids from the users' perspective. The study shows that optimization methods are the most popular cost-saving techniques reported in the literature. These methods are used to plan scheduling and power utilization schemes of household appliances, energy storages, renewables, and other energy generation devices. The survey shows that trading energy among neighborhoods is one of the effective methods for cost optimization. It also identifies the prediction methods that are used to forecast energy price, generation, and consumption profiles, which are required to optimize energy cost in advance. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, it discusses the computational methods reported in the literature with their significance and limitations. Second, it identifies the components and their characteristics that may reduce energy cost. Finally, it proposes a unified cost optimization framework and addresses the challenges that may influence the overall residential energy cost optimization problem in smart grids.},

abstract = {An interactive web tool was created to simulate 100{\%} renewable electricity supply scenarios for the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in the south-west of Western Australia. The SWIS is isolated from other grids and currently has no available hydropower. Hence it makes a good case study of how supply and demand might be balanced on an hour-by-hour basis and grid stability maintained without the benefit of energy import/export or pumped hydroelectric storage. The tool included regional models for wind and solar power, so that hypothetical power stations were not confined to sites with existing wind farms or solar power stations, or sites with measurements of wind speed and solar radiation. A generic model for solar thermal storage and simple models for energy efficiency, distributed battery storage and power to gas storage were also developed. Due to the urgency of climate change mitigation a rapid construction schedule of completion by 2030, rather than the more common target of 2050, was set. A scenario with high wind generation, and scenarios with varying levels of solar power, wind power, distributed battery storage, energy efficiency improvements and power to gas systems were considered. The battery storage system and PV arrays were configured to provide synthetic inertia to maintain grid stability (with a small loss in capacity for each), and existing synchronous generators were kept spinning with no fuel input, adding a small increase to the electrical load demand. The level of synthetic inertia provided by battery storage was estimated for each scenario. The results indicated that a balanced mix of solar PV, solar thermal, efficiency, and storage were the most feasible to be built on a rapid time scale. The required capacity and build rate of the generation and storage systems would be reduced if energy efficiency improvements were implemented on a more rapid schedule compared to the current global improvement rate. The scenario with very high levels of wind power (∼80{\%} generation) were found to be capable of meeting SWIS reliability criteria if very large amounts of distributed storage or some high capacity seasonal reserve generation system such as power to gas were present. High levels of battery storage capacity and efficiency improvement could be as effective as a power to gas system. It was confirmed that all scenarios provided the same or greater levels of inertia than presently provided by conventional generators. This tool showed that it is possible to examine renewable energy scenarios for regional electricity networks without high computing power.},

One of the important tasks in various Smart Grid applications, from demand-response to emergency management, is the short-term electricity load forecasting at different scales, from an individual customer to a whole portfolio of customers. In this work we perform a quantitative evaluation of different machine learning methods for short-term (1 hour ahead and 24 hour ahead) electricity load forecasting at the individual and aggregate level. We discuss the relevant features that best help to improve forecasting accuracy, as well as the effectiveness of exploiting correlations between different customers. Furthermore, for aggregate forecast, we explore different clustering techniques that can be used to segment the whole customer portfolio and show that forecasting each cluster separately and then aggregating the forecast produces better accuracy compared to the traditional approach (which forecast directly the aggregate load). We also found that the improvement provided by this strategy changes as a function of total customers.},

We examined how we could achieve very high-energy penetration from intermittent renewable system into the electricity grid. This study shows that the maximum threshold for the storage need is significantly less than the daily average demand. In the present study, we found that the approximate network energy storage is of the order of 186. GW. h/22. GW (approximately 22{\%} of the average daily demands of California). Allowing energy dumping was shown to increase storage use, and by that way, increases grid penetration and reduces the required backup conventional capacity requirements. Using the 186. GW. h/22. GW storage and at 20{\%} total energy loss, grid penetration was increased to approximately 85{\%} of the annual demand of the year while also reducing the conventional backup capacity requirement to 35. GW. This capacity was sufficient to supply the year round hourly demand, including 59 GW peak demand, plus a distribution loss of about 5.3{\%}.

Predicting electricity consumption at such very low scales should help to increase the efficiency of distribution networks and energy pricing. However, this is by no means a trivial task since household-level consumption is much more irregular than at the transmission or distribution levels. In this work, we address the problem of improving consumption forecasting by using the statistical relations between consumption series. This is done both at the household and district scales (hundreds of houses), using various machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine for regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). First, we determine which algorithm is best adapted to each scale, then, we try to find leaders among the time series, to help short-term forecasting. We also improve the forecasting for district consumption by clustering houses according to their consumption profiles.},

abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a flexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the field of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efficient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classification of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of specifically using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited field of research, quite different applications are identified with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver specific insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

abstract = {Liberalisation of energy markets, climate policy and the promotion of renewable energy have changed the framework conditions of the formerly strictly regulated energy markets. Generating companies are mainly affected by these changing framework conditions as they are exposed to the different risks from liberalised energy markets in combination with huge and largely irreversible investments. Uncertainties facing generating companies include: the development of product prices for electricity as well as for primary energy carriers; technological developments; availability of power plants; the development of regulation and political context, as well as the behaviour of competitors. The need for decision support tools in the energy business, mainly based on operation research models, has therefore significantly increased. Especially to cope with different uncertain parameters, several stochastic modelling approaches have been developed in the last few years for liberalised energy markets. In this context, the present paper aims to give an overview and classification of stochastic models dealing with price risks in electricity markets. The focus is thereby placed on various stochastic methods developed in operation research with practical relevance and applicability, including the concepts of: stochastic processes for commodity prices (especially for electricity);scenario generation and reduction, which is important due to the need for a structured handling of large data amounts; as well asstochastic optimising models for investment decisions, short- and mid-term power production planning and long-term system optimisation. The approaches within the energy business are classified according to the above structure. The practical relevance of the different methods and their applicability to real markets is thereby of crucial importance. Shortcomings of existing approaches and open issues that should be addressed by operation research are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi-agent model of an electricity market is proposed using the agent-based computational economics (ACE) methodology. The proposed methodology for modeling the bidding price behavior of Generation Companies (GENCOs) is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning) that uses some soft computing techniques to face the discovery of a complex function among bidding prices, states and profits. The proposed model also comprise the power system operation of a large-scale system by simulating optimal DC power flows (DCOPF) in order to obtain real dispatches of agents and a mapping from action space (bidding strategies) to quantities dispatched. In this model, agents are provided with learning capabilities so that they learn to bid depending on market prices and their risk perception so that profits are maximized. The proposed methodology is applied on colombian power market and some results about bidding strategies dynamics are shown. In addition, a new index defined as rate of market exploitation is introduced in order to characterize the agents bidding behavior.},

abstract = {Recognizing habitual behavior and providing feedback in context are key to empower individuals to take control over residential electricity consumption. Yet, it is a challenge to change habitual behavior, embedded in everyday routines. This paper intends to discover whether habitual behavior can be identified by pattern recognition techniques. The data source is an experiment similar to a utility led advanced metering infrastructure implementation. The analysis discovers: (1) persistent daily routines and (2) patterns of consumption or baselines typical of specific weather and daily conditions. Approximately 80{\%} of household electricity use can be explained within these two patterns, with several applicable "profiles" for this population, including: unoccupied baseline, hot working days, temperate working days, cold working days, and cold weekend days. The proposed methodology demonstrates that it is possible to use pattern recognition methodologies to recognize habitual electricity consumption behavior given the intrinsic characteristics of the family. This approach could be useful to improve small scale forecast, and as a mechanism to enable the provision of tailor-made information to the families. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The motorists are represented by agents that use heuristics to choose a fuel on the basis of three attributes and a social feedback loop. Adoption of specific fuels is mostly driven by price differences, but other factors play a role if prices are similar. The results are not always intuitive and do not always show up immediately. We find that sustained combinations of interventions are required to bring about a transition away from petrol or diesel. Adoption of alternative fuels was most often confined to niche markets with a share of 5{\%} or lower. Only in a single case was a complete fuel transition observed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

The multilayer perceptron model (MLP) has been used for this purpose by testing several possible architectures in order to be selected the one with the best generalizing ability. Actual recorded input and output data that influence long-term energy consumption were used in the training, validation and testing process. The developed ANN model is used for the prediction of 2005-2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015 Greek energy consumption. The produced ANN results for years 2005-2008 were compared with the results produced by a linear regression method, a support vector machine method and with real energy consumption records showing a great accuracy. The proposed approach can be useful in the effective implementation of energy policies, since accurate predictions of energy consumption affect the capital investment, the environmental quality, the revenue analysis, the market research management, while conserve at the same time the supply security. Furthermore it constitutes an accurate tool for the Greek long-term energy consumption prediction problem, which up today has not been faced effectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reviews the changing role of electricity systems modelling in a strategic manner, focussing on the modelling response to key developments, the move away from monopoly towards liberalised market regimes and the increasing complexity brought about by policy targets for renewable energy and emissions.

impacts on retail ratepayers as price caps, which were often imposed as an initial condition
of industry restructuring and deregulation, expired. Coupled with higher fossil fuel prices, retail consumers have seen the prices they pay for electricity increase significantly. These price increases have led some to question the competitiveness of wholesale markets and the mechanisms used to establish wholesale prices. These criticisms have also called into
question whether wholesale markets are adding value to the electric industry, or are only exacerbating price increases at the retail level. And, with questions raised over the value of wholesale markets have come policy recommendations to reregulate retail electric prices and have local electric utilities resume their past responsibilities for owning and operating generating plants, and undertaking long-term integrated resource planning activities that were common in the 1980s and 1990s.},

This paper discusses the factors that influence the consumers to steal electricity. In view of these ill effects, various methods for detection and estimation of the theft are discussed. This paper proposes an architectural design of smart meter, external control station, harmonic generator, and filter circuit. Motivation of this work is to deject illegal consumers, and conserve and effectively utilize energy. As well, smart meters are designed to provide data of various parameters related to instantaneous power consumption. NTL in the distribution feeder is computed by external control station from the sending end information of the distribution feeder. If a considerable amount of NTL is detected, harmonic generator is operated at that feeder for introducing additional harmonic component for destroying appliances of the illegal consumers. For illustration, cost-benefit analysis for implementation of the proposed system in India is presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Now that renewable technologies are both technically and commercially mature, the imperfect rational behaviour of investors becomes a critical factor in the future success of the energy transition. Here, we take an agent-based approach to model investor decision making in the electricity sector by modelling investors as actors with different (heterogeneous) anticipations of the future. With only a limited set of assumptions, this generic model replicates the dynamics of the liberalised electricity market of the last decades and points out dynamics that are to be expected as the energy transition progresses. Importantly, these dynamics are emergent properties of the evolving electricity system resulting from actor (investor) behaviour. We have experimented with varying carbon price scenarios and find that incorporating heterogeneous investor behaviour results in a large bandwidth of possible transition pathways, and that the depth of renewables penetration is correlated with the variability of their power generation pattern. Furthermore, a counter-intuitive trend was observed, namely that average profits of investors are seen to increase with carbon prices. These results are a vivid and generic illustration that outcome-based policy cannot be solely based on market instruments that rely on perfect rational and perfectly informed agents.},

abstract = {Large power sector CO2 emission reductions are needed to meet long-term climate change targets. Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXOS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions by 96{\%} and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40{\%}, 60{\%} and 80{\%} of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22{\%}, 41{\%} and 59{\%} of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12{\%} between the 40{\%} and 80{\%} RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2-3{\%} reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12{\%} reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80{\%} and 40{\%} RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0-1{\%} reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2{\%} reduction in 80{\%} RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1-3{\%} increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40{\%} for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70{\%} for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a "revenue gap" for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60{\%} and 80{\%} RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices.},

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. ?? 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

After an overview of first SD models in energy economics, a comprehensive review of models of deregulated electricity markets is presented. The review captures more than 80 publications in the field of SD energy market modeling. Some tendencies could be identified: Firstly SD models are more and more combined with other methods like generic algorithms, experimental economics or analytical hierarchy processes. Secondly, stochastic variables are considered increasingly. Thirdly, models show a higher level of detail and increasingly evaluate aspects such as new markets designs or new market components and their interdependencies.},

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0{\%}. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20{\%}, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3{\%}, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3{\%}. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of "injunctive norms" played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

With strong domestic production and relatively flat demand, the United States becomes a net energy exporter over the projection period in most cases. • Projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 (AEO2017) are not predictions of what will happen, but rather modeled projections of what may happen given certain assumptions and methodologies. • The AEO is developed using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), an integrated model that aims to capture various interactions of economic changes and energy supply, demand, and prices. • Energy market projections are subject to much uncertainty, as many of the events that shape energy markets and future developments in technologies, demographics, and resources cannot be foreseen with certainty. • More information about the assumptions used in developing these projections is available shortly after the release of each AEO. • The AEO is published pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Administrator to prepare annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply. • The Reference case projection assumes trend improvement in known technologies, along with a view of economic and demographic trends reflecting the current central views of leading economic forecasters and demographers. • It generally assumes that current laws and regulations affecting the energy sector, including sunset dates for laws that have them, are unchanged throughout the projection period. • The potential impacts of proposed legislation, regulations, or standards are not reflected in the Reference case. • EIA addresses the uncertainty inherent in energy projections by developing side cases with different assumptions of macroeconomic growth, world oil prices, technological progress, and energy policies. • Projections in the AEO should be interpreted with a clear understanding of the assumptions that inform them and the limitations inherent in any modeling effort. • Oil prices are driven by global market balances that are mainly influenced by factors external to the NEMS model. In the High Oil Price case, the price of Brent crude in 2016 dollars reaches {\$}226 per barrel (b) by 2040, compared to {\$}109/b in the Reference case and {\$}43/b in the Low Oil Price case. • In the High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, lower costs and higher resource availability than in the Reference case allow for higher production at lower prices.

Most models of energy, econ- omy, and the environment (E3 models) use exogenous assumptions for this. This is an important weakness. We show that there is strong evidence that technical change in the energy sector is to an important degree induced by market circumstances and expectations and, by implication, by environmental policies such as CO2 abate- ment. We classify the main approaches to modeling such induced technical change and review results with particular reference to climate change. Among models with learning by doing, weak responses are only obtained from models that are highly aggregated (lack technological diversity) and/or that equate rates of return to in- novation across sectors. Induced technical change broadens the scope of efficient policies toward mitigation, including not just research and development and aggre- gated market instruments but a range of sectoral-based policies potentially at divergent marginal costs. Furthermore, to the extent that cleaner technologies induced by mit- igation diffuse globally, a positive spillover will result that will tend to offset the substitution-based negative spillover usually hypothesized to result from the migration of polluting industries. Initial explorations suggest that this effect could also be very large.},

The work examines how much operational costs increase with more accurate resolution. Results show that increased temporal resolution captures more variability in system load and renewable generation, and is necessary to capture the inflexibilities of thermal units that lead to more realistic estimations in total generation costs. Significant cycling and ramping of units is also captured in higher resolution modelling that hourly resolution modelling is unable to capture. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, both energy consumption and CO2 emissions have been increasing in the residential sector of Japan. For this reason, smart meters have received much attention as a way to provide energy-use feedback to households and thereby encourage energy conservation. In order to provide effective feedback, it is necessary to take into account the lifestyle of each household, but little work has been done to develop a methodology to determine the relationship between a household's lifestyle and its electricity consumption. This paper proposes two methods that identify a household's lifestyle from electricity use data. By using a frequency analysis of weekly load profiles, we verified that, except in winter (December 2013-February 2014), the average daily consumption of morning-oriented lifestyles is 5.3{\%} less than that of night-oriented lifestyles. The results of cluster analyses of each household's daily electric load profiles suggest that most households consume less electricity when following a regular routine.},

abstract = {This report outlines the methods, data, and tools that could be used at different levels of sophistication and effort to estimate the benefits and costs of DGPV. In so doing, we identify the gaps in current benefit-cost-analysis methods, which we hope will inform the ongoing research agenda in this area. The focus of this report is primarily on benefits and costs from the utility or electricity generation system perspective. It is intended to provide useful background information to utility and regulatory decision makers and their staff, who are often being asked to use or evaluate estimates of the benefits and cost of DGPV in regulatory proceedings. Understanding the technical rigor of the range of methods and how they might need to evolve as DGPV becomes a more significant contributor of energy to the electricity system will help them be better consumers of this type of information. This report is also intended to provide information to utilities, policy makers, PV technology developers, and other stakeholders, which might help them maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of integrating DGPV into a changing electricity system.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a process for the classification of new residential electricity customers. The current state of the art is extended by using a combination of smart metering and survey data and by using model-based feature selection for the classification task. Firstly, the normalized representative consumption profiles of the population are derived through the clustering of data from households. Secondly, new customers are classified using survey data and a limited amount of smart metering data. Thirdly, regression analysis and model-based feature selection results explain the importance of the variables and which are the drivers of different consumption profiles, enabling the extraction of appropriate models. The results of a case study show that the use of survey data significantly increases accuracy of the classification task (up to 20{\%}). Considering four consumption groups, more than half of the customers are correctly classified with only one week of metering data, with more weeks the accuracy is significantly improved. The use of model-based feature selection resulted in the use of a significantly lower number of features allowing an easy interpretation of the derived models.},

We find that nation-wide low-carbon electricity supply is possible at about 160 GW installed capacity, at indicative cost of around 20 ¢/kWh, involving wind, concentrating solar, and PV utilities, and less than 20 TWh of biofuelled generation. Dispatchable hydro and biofuel plants are required to plug gaps caused by occasional low-resource periods. Technology and cost breakthroughs for storage, geothermal, and ocean technologies, as well as offshore wind deployment would substantially alter our assessment.},

abstract = {Electricity market liberalisation has become common practice internationally. The justification for this process has been to enhance competition in a market traditionally characterised by statutory monopolies in an attempt to reduce costs to end-users. This paper endeavours to see whether a pool market achieves this goal of increasing competition and reducing electricity prices. Here the electricity market is set up as a sealed bid second price auction. Theory predicts that such markets should result with firms bidding their marginal cost, thereby resulting in an efficient outcome and lower costs to consumers. The Irish electricity system with a gross pool market experiences among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Thus, we analyse the Irish pool system econometrically in order to test if the high electricity prices seen there are due to participants bidding outside of market rules or out of line with theory. Overall we do not find any evidence that the interaction between generator and the pool in the Irish electricity market is not efficient. Thus, the pool element of the market structure does not explain the high electricity prices experienced in Ireland. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We use field experiments to examine how consumers respond to two different types of policy intervention: social pressure and private incentives. Consumers in our experiment receive social pressure that requests them to reduce electricity usage in hours when the marginal cost of electricity is high. This social pressure does not involve any economic incentive. In addition to the social pressure, our second treatment group receives dynamic electricity pricing, a strong private incentive to save electricity: the hourly marginal price of electricity changes between 15 to 150 yen (15 to 150 cents) per kWh. We find that the social pressure itself reduces electricity consumption by 3{\%} to 4{\%}. However, the reduction is much larger when consumers are exposed to the dynamic pricing, in which the highest marginal price results in a reduction up to 15{\%}. Third, consumers in our experiment, who are well-informed about their hourly electricity price, actually respond to the change in hourly marginal price: higher hourly marginal prices produce larger reductions in consumption. Fourth, we investigate the heterogeneity in response to the social and private incentives. Compared to low-income consumers, high-income consumers respond to the social pressure more. Conversely, the response to the dynamic pricing is less for high-income consumers. Finally, we find that the response to the dynamic pricing is also larger for high-electricity users.},

It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the 'ideal' energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the 'ideal' energy tool.

The results indicate that individual interventions largely fail to induce long-term NGV diffusion. To promote a sustaining market share of NGVs at 14{\%} in 2030, a combined intervention should be introduced that includes: a converter kit subsidy of 5 M Rupiah for five years, a gradual increase of annual tax for oil-fueled vehicles to 2.5{\%} in 2030, increased perceived safety of NGVs to the same level as that of Low Cost Green Cars, and additional gas fueling stations.},

At the present time, requiring a meter as a prerequisite for power customers to choose a power supplier is not yet achievable. For customer screening, this paper proposes a technique that uses customers' monthly energy usage data to perform load profile assignment.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the use of an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate factors that can speed the diffusion of eco-innovations, namely alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The ABM provides the opportunity to consider the interdependencies inherent between key participants in the automotive industry: manufacturers, consumers, and governmental agencies. Agent-based models allow for tackling these interdependencies in a very elegant way. Because ABMs allow convenient modeling of the interactions between multiple agents, each with unique optimization goals, it provides a method for understanding consumer and manufacturer response to diverse environmental changes. Grounding the agent-based model on empirical data further improves the validity of the model results. We use choice-based conjoint data of more than 7,000 respondents to elicit heterogeneous consumer preferences. Further, information about manufacturers' cost structure is available from an established vehicle design tool, AVCEM. In three experiments, mechanisms are considered for speeding the adoption of AFVs: technology push, market pull, and regulatory push. Simulation results support the idea that technology push can be an important mechanism for speeding the diffusion of AFVs. Market pull, that is, word of mouth, also has a positive impact on the diffusion of AFVs and increases the social good by decreasing the preference for fuel-inefficient vehicles. Furthermore, word of mouth leads to a higher willingness to pay for AFVs, which indicates that the perceived value of AFVs increases with word of mouth. In contrast, a governmental push that focuses on the manufacturers (fuel economy mandates) leads to a decrease in the social good (air pollution improvement) because market share for fuel-inefficient vehicles increases. This article provides insights into how to set up an ABM to evaluate factors that influence the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles. These insights can be applied to other types of eco-innovations.},

In contrast, we can efficiently train and test much larger data sets using linear SVM without kernels. In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets.

The situation in Germany is even more pronounced because of the planned phase-out of nuclear energy. The high penetration of volatile decentralized renewables such as wind and solar energy contributes to a shift of the electric energy system. The present legally guaranteed priority over conventional power plants leads to a change of the characteristics of the residual load - defined as the difference between electricity demand and the amount supplied by renewables. In order to predict various system aspects with adequate accuracy, we developed a flexible, validated, and efficient simulation model. In this paper, we describe our model and apply it to investigate the properties of the residual load based on the electric energy system of the German federal state Bavaria. The simulation results show that the mean of the residual load will decline whereas the hours of negative residual load will increase over the next ten years.},

In this paper, in order to simultaneously resolve the transmission security and availability in SCADA group communications, we propose a robust and efficient group key management scheme, called LiSH, which is characterized by developing a secure self-healing mechanism with t-revocation capability using one-way function to protect current session keys from being attacked by intruders. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed LiSH scheme is secure in terms of collusion-free, and t-wise forward and backward security. In addition, performance evaluation also demonstrates its efficiency in terms of low storage and communication overheads.},

The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

However, the limited electric range of PEVs could impede their market introduction. Still some potential users are willing to pay more for PEVs. The combined effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are unclear. Here, we study the market evolution of PEVs in Germany until 2020. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of PEVs due to external conditions and the users' willingness to pay. We find the future share of PEVs in German passenger car stock to range from 0.4{\%} to almost 3{\%} by 2020. Energy prices have a large impact on PEV market evolution as a 25{\%} increase in fuel prices would double the number of PEVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a special depreciation allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1000. Euro as the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. The high uncertainty of the market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of PEVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we soft-link a long-term energy system model, which explores new energy system configurations from years to decades, with a high spatial and temporal resolution power system model that captures VRE variability from hours to years. Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that VRE-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate VRE into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

We find evidence for a large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence for intrinsic dispersion in the correlation between L{\_}QSO and L{\_}IR, suggesting that the latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formation and black hole accretion. This is consistent with the idea that both the quasar activity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, so that they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heating of gas via feedback processes.},

abstract = {Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, th- - e deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.},

Two ANNs, a three-layered back-propagation and a recurrent neural network, were designed and tested for the purpose. Predictions were done for target years 1999, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, respectively. Two case studies, preservation of the status and structure reform, were also tested for predicting the loads of years 2010 and 2020. Unlike short-term load forecasting, long-term load forecasting is mainly affected by economical factors rather than weather conditions. This study focuses on economical data that seem to influence long-term electric load demands. Here, 10 factors are selected as inputs for the proposed ANNs: (1) gross national product, (2) gross domestic product, (3) population, (4) number of households, (5) number of air-conditioners, (6) amount of CO2 pollution, (7) index of industrial production, (8) oil price, (9) energy consumption, and (10) electricity price. The data used are: actual yearly, incremental growth rate from the previous year, and both together (actual and incremental growth rate from the previous year). As a result, the demands for 2010 and 2020 are predicted to be 225.779 and 249.617GW, respectively (preservation of the status). With structure reform, the demands for 2010 and 2020 are predicted to be 219.259 and 244.508GW.},

This paper uses an integrated multi-regional multi-fleet system dynamics model of New Zealand's energy economy to assess the primary impacts of alternative vehicle fleet technologies. Results suggest that hydrogen fuelled HICEs and FCVs may offer significantly greater economic savings than BEVs due to a much lower capital cost. Under our Base Case, 65{\%} of the light fleet are HICEs and FCVs and 5{\%} BEVs. Excluding hydrogen vehicles from the vehicle fleet can result in an average annual cost of US{\$}562 per vehicle between 2015 and 2050.

@article{Al-Musaylh2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Accurate and reliable forecasting models for electricity demand (G) are critical in engineering applications. They assist renewable and conventional energy engineers, electricity providers, end-users, and government entities in addressing energy sustainability challenges for the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia, including the expansion of distribution networks, energy pricing, and policy development. In this study, data-driven techniques for forecasting short-term (24-h) G-data are adopted using 0.5 h, 1.0 h, and 24 h forecasting horizons. These techniques are based on the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. This study is focused in Queensland, Australia's second largest state, where end-user demand for energy continues to increase. To determine the MARS and SVR model inputs, the partial autocorrelation function is applied to historical (area aggregated) G data in the training period to discriminate the significant (lagged) inputs. On the other hand, single input G data is used to develop the univariate ARIMA model. The predictors are based on statistically significant lagged inputs and partitioned into training (80{\%}) and testing (20{\%}) subsets to construct the forecasting models. The accuracy of the G forecasts, with respect to the measured G data, is assessed using statistical metrics such as the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Normalized model assessment metrics based on RMSE and MAE relative to observed means (RMSE G¯ andMAE G¯ ), Willmott's Index (WI), Legates and McCabe Index (E LM ), and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients (E NS ) are also utilised to assess the models' preciseness. For the 0.5 h and 1.0 h short-term forecasting horizons, the MARS model outperforms the SVR and ARIMA models displaying the largest WI (0.993 and 0.990) and lowest MAE (45.363 and 86.502 MW), respectively. In contrast, the SVR model is superior to the MARS and ARIMA models for the daily (24 h) forecasting horizon demonstrating a greater WI (0.890) and MAE (162.363 MW). Therefore, the MARS and SVR models can be considered more suitable for short-term G forecasting in Queensland, Australia, when compared to the ARIMA model. Accordingly, they are useful scientific tools for further exploration of real-time electricity demand data forecasting.},

First of all, an argument is provided why multi- agent simulation is the appropriate tool to study behavioural dynamics. Next it is being argued that a generic model of human behaviour is needed, because environmental relevant behaviour is not a specific category of behaviour. Such a generic model would include human needs and decision making as elementary parts. Because the practical use of models including human behaviour is by en large determined by the possibility to conduct policy experiments, the formalisation of rules is being structured along the dimensions of product, price, place and promotion, these elements constituting the basic marketing strategies to influence behaviour. The paper concludes with a discussion on validation and prediction of model outcomes, and a number of issues to be addressed in the development of applicable models},

Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100{\%} WWS will be similar to the cost today.

abstract = {One of the goals of efficient water supply management is the regular supply of clean water at the pressure required by consumers. In this context, predicting water consumption in urban areas is of key importance for water supply management. This prediction is also relevant in processes for reviewing prices; as well as for operational management of a water network. In this paper, we describe and compare a series of predictive models for forecasting water demand. The models are obtained using time series data from water consumption in an urban area of a city in south-eastern Spain. This includes highly non-linear time series data, which has conditioned the type of models we have included in our study. Namely, we have considered artificial neural networks, projection pursuit regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forests and support vector regression. Apart from these models, we also propose a simple model based on the weighted demand profile resulting from our exploratory analysis of the data.In our comparative study, all predictive models were evaluated using an experimental methodology for hourly time series data that detailed water demand in a hydraulic sector of a water supply network in a city in south-eastern Spain. The accuracy of the obtained results, together with the medium size of the demand area, suggests that this was a suitable environment for making adequate management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In theory, In-Home Displays (IHDs) can revolutionize the way utilities communicate information to customers because they can induce changes in customer behavior even when they are not accompanied by a change in electric prices or rebates for purchasing efficient equipment. IHDs provide consumers with direct feedback-real-time information on energy consumption and costs-and turn a once opaque and static electric bill into a transparent, dynamic, and controllable process. However, to what extent do consumers actually respond to the direct feedback provided by IHDs? In this paper, we seek to empirically answer this question by reviewing a dozen utility pilot programs in North America and abroad that focus on the energy conservation impact of IHDs. We also review overall customer opinions and attitudes towards IHDs and direct feedback to the extent that this information is available from the pilot studies. Our review indicates that the direct feedback provided by IHDs encourages consumers to make more efficient use of energy. We find that consumers who actively use an IHD can reduce their consumption of electricity on average by about 7 percent when prepayment of electricity is not involved. When consumers both use an IHD and are on an electricity prepayment system, they can reduce their electricity consumption by about twice that amount. In regard to demand response impacts, we find that the impact of time-of-use rates is augmented by direct feedback from IHDs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of learning and risk aversion on generation company (GenCo) bidding behavior in an oligopolistic electricity market. To this end, a flexible agent-based simulation model is developed in which GenCo agents bid prices in each period. Taking transmission grid constraints into account, the ISO solves a DC-OPF problem to determine locational prices and dispatch quantities. Our simulations show how, due to competition and learning, the change in the risk aversion level of even one GenCo can have a significant impact on all GenCo bids and profits. In particular, some level of risk aversion is observed to be beneficial to GenCos, whereas excessive risk aversion degrades profits by causing intense price competition. Our comprehensive study on the effects of Q-learning parameters finds the level of exploration to have a large impact on the outcome. The results of this paper can help GenCos develop bidding strategies that consider their rivals' as well as their own learning behavior and risk aversion levels. Likewise, the results can help regulators in designing market rules that take realistic GenCo behavior into account.},

abstract = {Abstract Smart grid, an integral part of a smart city, provides new opportunities for efficient energy management, possibly leading to big cost savings and a great contribution to the environment. Grid innovations and liberalization of the electricity market have significantly changed the character of data analysis in power engineering. Online processing of large amounts of data continuously generated by the smart grid can deliver timely and precise power load forecasts – an important input for interactions on the market where the energy can be contracted even minutes ahead of its consumption to minimize the grid imbalances. We demonstrate the suitability of online support vector regression (SVR) method to short term power load forecasting and thoroughly explore its pros and cons. We present a comparison of ten state-of-the-art forecasting methods in terms of accuracy on public Irish {\{}CER{\}} dataset.

abstract = {Energy prediction models are used in buildings as a performance evaluation engine in advanced control and optimisation, and in making informed decisions by facility managers and utilities for enhanced energy efficiency. Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction – for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.},

This paper presents a social simulation (or agent-based model) that aims going one step in validating a dynamic psychological decision micro-theory that has been developed to include goals, deliberative decisions as well as status quo bias, social milieus, communication over personal networks, and sensitivity towards external events such as price changes or messages from the media. We show how the simulation replicates a set of customer data from a German green energy provider, reproducing the temporal and spatial diffusion of adoption of their product. The building of the simulation is supported by a survey (N = 778) investigating the psychological variables relating to the adoption of green energy and lifestyles (milieus), and online experiments about personal networks and information processing style. A scenario, i.e. an experiment run within the simulation, introduces more frequent communication between households that is interpreted as the effect of an information campaign. The frequency of personal communication and a salient event reported in the media interact to foster green energy adoption. We argue that social simulation proves being an appropriate tool to develop and test dynamic psychological theories.},

Our intention is to give a balanced assessment of the potential of artificial neural networks for forecasting and decision making models.

In the deregulated power system, an improvement of a few percentages in the prediction accuracy would bring benefits worth of millions of dollars, which makes load forecasting become more important than ever before. This paper focuses on the short-term load forecasting for a power system in the U.S., where several alternative meteorological forecasts are available from different commercial weather services. To effectively take advantage of the alternative meteorological predictions in the load forecasting system, a new comprehensive forecasting methodology has been proposed in this paper. Specifically, combining forecasting using adaptive coefficients is applied to share the strength of the different temperature forecasts in the first stage, and then, ensemble neural networks have been used to improve the model's generalization performance based on bagging. The proposed load forecasting system has been verified by using the real data from the utility. A range of comparisons with different forecasting models have been conducted. The forecasting results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {The influence of economic and demographic variables on the annual electricity consumption in Italy has been investigated with the intention to develop a long-term consumption forecasting model. The time period considered for the historical data is from 1970 to 2007. Different regression models were developed, using historical electricity consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita) and population. A first part of the paper considers the estimation of GDP, price and GDP per capita elasticities of domestic and non-domestic electricity consumption. The domestic and non-domestic short run price elasticities are found to be both approximately equal to -0.06, while long run elasticities are equal to -0.24 and -0.09, respectively. On the contrary, the elasticities of GDP and GDP per capita present higher values. In the second part of the paper, different regression models, based on co-integrated or stationary data, are presented. Different statistical tests are employed to check the validity of the proposed models. A comparison with national forecasts, based on complex econometric models, such as Markal-Time, was performed, showing that the developed regressions are congruent with the official projections, with deviations of ±1{\%} for the best case and ±11{\%} for the worst. These deviations are to be considered acceptable in relation to the time span taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lincoln2009,
abstract = {Increasingly, the electric energy transmitted and distributed by national power systems is traded competitively in free markets. Long-term decisions must be made by authorities as to the structure of energy markets and the regulations that govern interactions between participants. It is not practical to experiment with real energy markets and in order to establish the potential effects of making these decisions there are few options but to simulate the markets computationally. This paper proposes that the complexity of power systems and the associated energy markets necessitates an open approach in their modelling and simulation. It presents an open source software package for simulating electric energy markets using the Python programming language. Power systems and their associated constraints are modelled using traditional steady-state analysis techniques. While market participants are represented by reactive agents that learn through reinforcement. The software and all of its dependencies are open and freely available to the scientific community.},

abstract = {Countries around the world continue to restructure their electricity markets and open them up to competition and private investors in pursuit of economic efficiency and new capital investment. However, the recent volatility exhibited by many restructured power markets, in combination with several prominent market failures, have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the complex interactions between the various market participants and the emerging overall market behavior. Advanced modeling approaches are needed that simulate the behavior of electricity markets over time and model how market participants may act and react to changes in the underlying economic, financial, and regulatory environments. This is particularly useful for developing sound market rules that will allow these markets to function properly. A new and promising approach is to model electricity markets as complex adaptive systems using an agent-based modeling and simulation approach, such as is implemented in the electricity market complex adaptive system (EMCAS) software. EMCAS provides an agent-based framework to capture and investigate the complex interactions between the physical infrastructures and the economic behavior of market participants that are a trademark of the newly emerging markets. This paper describes the EMCAS agents, their interactions, the unique insights obtained from agent-based models, and discusses current model applications in several U.S., Asian, and European markets.},

Frequency and voltage derivatives are important indicators to reflect the degree of disturbances and manifest power system dynamics. However, current computational methods for the indicators have noticeable drawbacks with respect to the accuracy. Wavelet transform-based multiresolution analysis (WT-based MRA) is introduced to obtain the characteristics of the indicators by computed maximum wavelet coefficients (WCs). Results from numerical experiments show a superior performance of WT-based MRA over the existing methods. Generation loss and load change as two major types of disturbances are studied to verify the proposed method. The disturbances are simulated in PSS/E for IEEE New England 39-bus system. The relationship of maximum WCs and power variation is discussed. Maximum WCs can provide enough information to distinguish the location of generation loss and estimate the load power variation.},

abstract = {Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology is used to model and predict Turkey's electricity consumption. Among various SVR formalisms, $\epsilon$-SVR method was used since the training pattern set was relatively small. Electricity consumption is modeled as a function of socio-economic indicators such as population, Gross National Product, imports and exports. In order to facilitate future predictions of electricity consumption, a separate SVR model was created for each of the input variables using their current and past values; and these models were combined to yield consumption prediction values. A grid search for the model parameters was performed to find the best $\epsilon$-SVR model for each variable based on Root Mean Square Error. Electricity consumption of Turkey is predicted until 2026 using data from 1975 to 2006. The results show that electricity consumption can be modeled using Support Vector Regression and the models can be used to predict future electricity consumption. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Electricity consumer dishonesty is a problem faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards nontechnical loss (NTL) detection in power utilities using an artifi- cial intelligence based technique, support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in peninsular Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to abnormalities and fraud activities, i.e., electricity theft. The fraud detection model (FDM) developed in this research study preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite fraud based on irregularities in consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining, which involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. This SVM based approach uses customer load profile in- formation and additional attributes to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields customer classes which are used to shortlist potential suspects for onsite inspection based on significant behavior that emerges due to fraud activities. Model testing is performed using historical kWh consumption data for three towns within penin- sular Malaysia. Feedback from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite inspection indicates that the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by them. With the implementation of this new fraud detection system TNBD's detection hitrate will increase from 3{\%} to 60{\%}.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are warming the Earth and causing changes in the global climate with increasingly severe human, economic and environmental impacts. Scientific evidence indicates that, to prevent climate change from reaching the most dangerous proportions, the world needs to stop the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 at the latest and then reduce them sharply - by at least half of 1990 levels by 2050, and more after that. Emissions trading systems are among the most cost-effective tools for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union launched the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2005 as the cornerstone of its strategy for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases at least cost. In contrast to traditional ‘command and control' regulation, emissions trading harnesses market forces to find the cheapest ways of reducing emissions. The EU ETS is the world's first major carbon market and remains by far the biggest today. The first international emissions trading system to address greenhouse gas emissions from companies, the European system accounts for over three-quarters of the trading volume of the international carbon market and functions as its engine. By putting a price on carbon and thereby giving a financial value to each tonne of emissions saved, the EU ETS has placed climate change on the agenda of company boards across Europe. A sufficiently high carbon price also promotes investment in clean, low-carbon technologies. By allowing companies to buy credits from emission-saving projects around the world, the EU ETS also acts as a major driver of investment in clean technologies and low-carbon solutions, particularly in developing countries. While the regulatory framework of the EU ETS was largely unchanged for the first two trading periods of its operation, the beginning of the third trading period in 2013 brings a major reform based on common rules which will strengthen the system. This factsheet explains the EU ETS as it stood in October 2013},

First, the typical day loads of users are calculated separately according to different date types (ordinary workdays, day before holidays, holidays). Second, the similarity between user electricity behaviors is mined and the user electricity loads are clustered to classify the users with similar behaviors into the same cluster. Finally, the load forecasting model based on the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is applied to different clusters to conduct load forecasting and the load forecast is summed to obtain the system load. In order to prove the validity of the proposed method, we performed simulation experiments on the MATLAB platform using smart meter data from the Ireland electric power cooperation. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to mine the user electricity behaviors deeply, improve the accuracy of load forecasting by the reasonable clustering of users, and reveal the relationship between forecasting accuracy and cluster numbers.},

@article{Rousseeuw1987,
abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects he well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate' number of clusters.},

@article{Kim2000,
abstract = {Conventional artificial neural network (ANN) based short-term load forecasting techniques have limitations in their use on holidays. This is due to dissimilar load behaviors of holidays compared with those of ordinary weekdays during the year and to insufficiency of training patterns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new short-term load forecasting method for special days in anomalous load conditions. These days include public holidays, consecutive holidays, and days preceding and following holidays. The proposed method uses a hybrid approach of ANN based tech- nique and fuzzy inference method to forecast the hourly loads of special days. In this method, special days are classified into five different day-types. Five ANN models for each day-type are used to forecast the scaled load curves of special days, and two fuzzy inference models are used to forecast the maximum and the min- imum loads of special days. Finally, the results of the ANN and the fuzzy inference models are combined to forecast the 24 hourly loads of special days. The proposed method was tested with actual load data of special days for the years of 1996–1997. The test results showed very accurate forecasting with the average percentage rel- ative error of 1.78{\%}.},
